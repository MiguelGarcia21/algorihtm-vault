# 🔍 Searching Algorithms

> ⚠️ **Work in Progress**  
> This repository is currently under active development. The implementations and examples are yet to be added or finalized. Expect frequent updates and improvements.

This folder contains implementations and explanations of classic **searching algorithms** used to locate elements or paths in datasets and graphs.

## ✅ Included Algorithms

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** – Shortest path in weighted graphs (non-negative edges)
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm** – Shortest path (supports negative weights)
- **Dungeon Master** – Example BFS grid problem using shortest path logic

## 📊 Concepts

- **Binary Search**: Efficient search on sorted data
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Level-order traversal (used in unweighted graphs)
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Recursive exploration (used in backtracking, component detection)
- **Shortest Path Algorithms**: Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, A*

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each subfolder contains:
- C++ code as a (`main.cpp`)
- `README.md` with:
  - Algorithm explanation
  - Time and space complexity
  - Input/output format
  - Sample usage or problems

## 🧠 Use Cases

- Pathfinding (e.g., games, maps)
- Network routing
- Optimization problems
