# 🔢 Sorting Algorithms
> ⚠️ **Work in Progress**  
> This repository is currently under active development. The implementations and examples are yet to be added or finalized. Expect frequent updates and improvements.

This folder includes advanced and foundational **sorting algorithms** used to organize data.

## ✅ Included Topics

- **Topological Sort** (DFS-based and Kahn's Algorithm)

## 🔄 Common Sorting Algorithms (to be added)

- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort
- Counting Sort
- Radix Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Quickselect (for k-th element)

## 📚 Concepts

- **Stable vs Unstable Sorts**
- **In-place vs Out-of-place**
- **Time Complexities**: Best, Average, and Worst-case
- **Use Cases**: Efficient lookup, range queries, scheduling, graph processing

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each sub-algorithm has:
- `main.cpp` implementation
- A dedicated `README.md` with:
  - Step-by-step explanation
  - Dry-run examples
  - Time/space complexity
  - Real-world applications

## 🔗 Special Sorting Algorithms

Some algorithms like **Topological Sort** apply to DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) and serve scheduling and dependency resolution problems, not numerical sorting.
